General Rules:

One sentence or a concise list-style sentence.

Start with the biggest benefits first (stress → physical → cognitive → long-term).

Keep the tone factual, confident, non-medicalizing.

Avoid exaggerated claims ("cures," "eliminates," "guarantees").

Keep it flowing, not bullet-pointy.

Example:

Reduces stress and anxiety, lowers heart rate and blood pressure, improves focus and mental clarity, promotes better sleep, strengthens the diaphragm, increases oxygen flow to the brain, and helps manage pain and chronic conditions.
