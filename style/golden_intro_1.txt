This practice invites you to slow down and notice your breath in this moment. You don't have to force anything. You might simply observe the gentle rise and fall in your chest.

If your mind wanders, that's okay. You can always come back to the feeling of air moving in and out.

When you're ready, you can return to your day with a bit more space inside.
