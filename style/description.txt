General Rules:

2–4 sentences.

Warm, clear, informative tone.

Explain what the exercise is and why it matters.

Use simple physiology terms (diaphragm, parasympathetic, etc.) but keep it accessible.

Avoid metaphors unless extremely subtle; prioritize clarity.

Example:

Deep breathing, also known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing, is a foundational practice that engages your diaphragm to promote full oxygen exchange. This technique activates the parasympathetic nervous system, shifting your body from "fight or flight" mode into a state of calm and restoration. By breathing slowly and deeply into your belly rather than shallowly into your chest, you encourage complete air circulation and reduce tension throughout your body.
