General Rules:

3–5 sentences.

Direct, step-by-step, simple.

Always begin with posture or setup.

Use gentle instruction verbs: Find, Place, Inhale, Exhale, Repeat.

Keep timing clear (e.g., "inhale for 6 seconds").

Avoid metaphors; focus on physical cues.

Example:

Find a comfortable seated or lying position. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Inhale slowly through your nose for 6 seconds, allowing your belly to rise while your chest remains relatively still. Exhale gently through your nose or mouth for 6 seconds, feeling your belly fall. The hand on your belly should move more than the one on your chest. Repeat for 5–10 minutes.
