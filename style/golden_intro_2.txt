Take a moment to settle into your body. There's no rush here, no right or wrong way to breathe. You might notice how your breath feels right now—perhaps shallow, perhaps deep, perhaps somewhere in between.

Each breath is simply an invitation to be present. You can follow along at your own pace, knowing that your body already knows how to breathe.
