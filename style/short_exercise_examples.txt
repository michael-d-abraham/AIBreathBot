The 4-7-8 breathing practice invites you to gently slow your breath. You might notice your body softening as you breathe in for 4 counts, pause for 7, and exhale slowly for 8. There's no need to get it perfect—each round is simply a chance to notice.

Box breathing offers a steady rhythm you can return to anytime. Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, and pause for 4. You might find this pattern creates a sense of stability in your body.

Equal breathing helps you find balance. Inhale and exhale for the same count—perhaps 4, perhaps 5, whatever feels natural. There's no pressure to match anyone else's pace.
